  <h2>Extraction Is Not Strength</h2>

  <p>
    Strong coffee is not highly extracted coffee.
    It is highly concentrated coffee.
  </p>

  <p>
    Extraction measures how much material leaves the bean.
    Strength measures how much material is in the cup.
  </p>

  <p>
    You can have strong under-extracted coffee.
    You can have weak over-extracted coffee.
  </p>

  <p>
    Confusing these is why most coffee tastes bad.

  <h2>Flavor Does Not Exist in Coffee</h2>

  <p>
    Coffee does not contain “chocolate” or “berries.”
  </p>

  <p>
    It contains acids, alcohols, phenols, and aromatics.
    Your brain turns them into memories.
  </p>

  <p>
    Taste is not detection.
    It is interpretation.
  </p>
</section>

  <section class="brew-section reveal">
  <h2>The Sensory Stack</h2>

  <p>
    Coffee flavor is built in layers.
  </p>

  <p>
    Aroma comes first.
    Then acidity.
    Then sweetness.
    Then body.
    Then finish.
  </p>

  <p>
    What you call “taste” is actually sequence.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="brew-section">
  <h2>The Control Variables</h2>

  <p>
    Every brew method manipulates the same small set of forces.
  </p>

  <p>
    Grind size controls surface area.  
    Water controls solubility.  
    Time controls sequencing.  
    Agitation controls speed.  
    Ratio controls concentration.
  </p>

  <p>
    Recipes are just fixed positions inside this system.
  </p>
</section>

  <section class="brew-section reveal">
  <h2>The Three Stages of Extraction</h2>

  <p>
    Coffee does not extract evenly.
  </p>

  <p>
    First come acids and volatile aromatics.
    Then sugars and oils.
    Then bitter structural compounds.
  </p>

  <p>
    Great coffee is not strength.
    It is timing.
