# BrewNotes ☕

BrewNotes is a living coffee knowledge system.
It explores coffee as a process — from plant to perception.

This project is built as an editorial-style educational website that explains:
- brew methods as extraction systems
- coffee science and chemistry
- equipment philosophy
- how flavor actually forms
