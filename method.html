  <h2>How to Read This Page</h2>

  <p>
    This page is not a catalog of brewers.
    It is a map of extraction environments.
  </p>

  <p>
    Each method below is explained not by steps,
    but by the forces it uses.
  </p>

  <p>
    Focus on what changes.
    Pressure. Time. Contact. Filtration.
  </p>
</section>

  <h2>Pour Over</h2>
  <p>
    Pour over is gravity-driven extraction. Water passes once through coffee.
  </p>
  <p>
    It emphasizes clarity, acidity, and separation of flavors.
  </p>
  <p>
    Pour over rewards grind control, pouring structure, and patience.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="brew-section">
  <h2>Espresso</h2>
  <p>
    Espresso is pressurized extraction. Water is forced through coffee at high pressure.
  </p>
  <p>
    It emphasizes body, oils, dissolved solids, and intensity.
  </p>
  <p>
    Espresso compresses chemistry into seconds. Small changes create massive shifts.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="brew-section">
  <h2>French Press</h2>
  <p>
    French press is full immersion brewing. Coffee steeps entirely in water.
  </p>
  <p>
    It emphasizes texture, oils, and roundness.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is forgiving, but reveals grind quality more than technique.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="brew-section">
  <h2>Cold Brew</h2>
  <p>
    Cold brew extracts without heat, over long time scales.
  </p>
  <p>
    It emphasizes sugars, low acidity, and heavy compounds.
  </p>
  <p>
    Cold brewing changes not just strength, but chemical balance.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="brew-section">
  <h2>AeroPress</h2>
  <p>
    AeroPress is a hybrid system. Immersion plus pressure.
  </p>
  <p>
    It allows control over time, turbulence, and force.
  </p>
  <p>
    AeroPress is less a method and more a brewing laboratory.
  </p>

<h2>The Brew Method Landscape</h2>

<div class="map-frame">

  This landscape is not exact.
  It is conceptual.
  Its purpose is not precision.
  Its purpose is orientation.
  <br><br>
  Over time, BrewNotes will turn this into an interactive system.

  <h2>Methods Are Systems</h2>

  <p>
    A brew method is not an action.
    It is a controlled system.
  </p>

  <p>
    Change the system and the same bean
    expresses a different personality.
  </p>

  <p>
    BrewNotes exists to isolate those systems.
  </p>
</section>

  <section class="brew-section reveal">
  <h2>Methods Are Tradeoffs</h2>

  <p>
    Every method amplifies something
    and sacrifices something.
  </p>

  <p>
    Clarity trades body.
    Speed trades control.
    Pressure trades forgiveness.
  </p>

  <p>
    There is no best method.
    Only intended outcomes.
  </p>
</section>

  <section class="brew-section reveal">
  <h2>Methods Shape Perception</h2>

  <p>
    The same coffee tastes different
    because methods emphasize different compounds.
  </p>

  <p>
    Espresso amplifies texture.
    Pour-over amplifies separation.
    Immersion amplifies integration.
  </p>

  <p>
    Methods do not change beans.
    They change what reaches you.
  </p>

  <h2>What BrewNotes Tracks</h2>

  <p>
    BrewNotes does not document tools.
    It documents relationships.
  </p>

  <p>
    Between force and flavor.
    Between structure and sensation.
    Between design and chemistry.
  </p>

  <p>
    Every future update deepens this map.
