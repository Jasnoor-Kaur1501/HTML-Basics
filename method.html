<h1>Brew Methods</h1>
<p>Different methods extract different stories from the same bean.</p>

<div class="stack">
<div class="block reveal"><h2>Pour Over</h2><p>Slow, controlled, clarity-driven.</p></div>
<div class="block reveal"><h2>Espresso</h2><p>Pressure. Speed. Concentration.</p></div>
<div class="block reveal"><h2>French Press</h2><p>Immersion for body and oils.</p></div>

  <section class="brew-section">
  <h2>Pour Over</h2>
  <p>
    Pour over is gravity-driven extraction. Water passes once through coffee.
  </p>
  <p>
    It emphasizes clarity, acidity, and separation of flavors.
  </p>
  <p>
    Pour over rewards grind control, pouring structure, and patience.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="brew-section">
  <h2>Espresso</h2>
  <p>
    Espresso is pressurized extraction. Water is forced through coffee at high pressure.
  </p>
  <p>
    It emphasizes body, oils, dissolved solids, and intensity.
  </p>
  <p>
    Espresso compresses chemistry into seconds. Small changes create massive shifts.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="brew-section">
  <h2>French Press</h2>
  <p>
    French press is full immersion brewing. Coffee steeps entirely in water.
  </p>
  <p>
    It emphasizes texture, oils, and roundness.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is forgiving, but reveals grind quality more than technique.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="brew-section">
  <h2>Cold Brew</h2>
  <p>
    Cold brew extracts without heat, over long time scales.
  </p>
  <p>
    It emphasizes sugars, low acidity, and heavy compounds.
  </p>
  <p>
    Cold brewing changes not just strength, but chemical balance.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="brew-section">
  <h2>AeroPress</h2>
  <p>
    AeroPress is a hybrid system. Immersion plus pressure.
  </p>
  <p>
    It allows control over time, turbulence, and force.
  </p>
  <p>
    AeroPress is less a method and more a brewing laboratory.
  </p>

<h2>The Brew Method Landscape</h2>

  <p style="max-width:600px; margin:40px auto 0; opacity:0.7;">
  This landscape is not exact.
  It is conceptual.
  Its purpose is not precision.
  Its purpose is orientation.

  <section class="brew-section reveal">
  <h2>Methods Are Tradeoffs</h2>

  <p>
    Every method amplifies something
    and sacrifices something.
  </p>

  <p>
    Clarity trades body.
    Speed trades control.
    Pressure trades forgiveness.
  </p>

  <p>
    There is no best method.
    Only intended outcomes.
