  <h2>Methods Are Not Recipes</h2>

  <p>
    Brew methods are not instructions. They are systems.
  </p>

  <p>
    Every method is a way of controlling how water meets coffee.
    Pressure. Flow. Contact time. Turbulence. Filtration.
  </p>

  <p>
    Espresso, pour-over, cold brew — these are not drinks.
    They are extraction environments.
  </p>

  <h2>The Two Brewing Families</h2>

  <p>
    Almost every brew method belongs to one of two families.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Immersion</strong> — coffee sits fully in water.  
    (French press, cupping, cold brew)
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Percolation</strong> — water flows through coffee.  
    (Pour-over, drip machines, espresso)
  </p>

  <p>
    Immersion maximizes uniformity.  
    Percolation maximizes control.
  </p>
</section>

  <section class="brew-section">
  <h2>Pressure vs Gravity</h2>

  <p>
    Some brewers rely on gravity. Others force water through coffee.
  </p>

  <p>
    Gravity methods are slow, gentle, and clarity-driven.
    Pressure methods are fast, violent, and texture-driven.
  </p>

  <p>
    Espresso compresses extraction into seconds.
    Pour-over stretches it across minutes.
  </p>

  <p>
    The force you use decides which compounds dominate the cup.
  </p>

  <section class="brew-section">
  <h2>Contact Time Spectrum</h2>

  <p>
    Coffee can extract in seconds or in hours.
  </p>

  <p>
    Espresso: 20–35 seconds  
    Pour-over: 2–4 minutes  
    French press: 4–6 minutes  
    Cold brew: 12–24 hours
  </p>

  <p>
    Short contact emphasizes acids and aromatics.
    Long contact emphasizes sugars and heavier compounds.
  </p>

  <p>
    Time is not convenience. It is chemistry.
