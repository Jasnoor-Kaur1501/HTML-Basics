  <h1>Learn coffee the real way.</h1>
  <p>BrewNotes is a living coffee knowledge system. From beans to bitterness. From tools to taste.</p>

  <h2>What is BrewNotes?</h2>
  <p>
    BrewNotes is not recipes. It’s understanding.  
    Why grind changes flavor. Why water matters. Why espresso is violent and pour-over is slow.

  <h2>Before Coffee Is Coffee</h2>

  <p>
    Coffee doesn’t begin in cafés. It begins as a fruit.
    What we call a “coffee bean” is actually a seed inside a cherry.
    Every cup you drink is the end of a long biological, chemical,
    and human process.
  </p>

  <p>
    Coffee plants grow in a narrow belt around the Earth called the
    “Coffee Belt” — between the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn.
    Here, altitude, rainfall, soil, and temperature decide how your coffee
    will eventually taste.
  </p>

  <p>
    Two species dominate the world: Arabica and Robusta.
    Arabica is delicate, complex, acidic, and aromatic.
    Robusta is stronger, more bitter, higher in caffeine, and easier to grow.
  </p>

  <p>
    There are others too — Liberica and Excelsa — rarer, stranger,
    and often described as smoky, woody, or wildly fruity.
