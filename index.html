    <h1>Learn coffee the real way.</h1>
    <p>
      BrewNotes is a living coffee knowledge system.
      From beans to bitterness. From tools to taste.

    <h2>What is BrewNotes?</h2>
    <p>
      BrewNotes is not recipes. It’s understanding.  
      Why grind changes flavor. Why water matters.
      Why espresso is violent and pour-over is slow.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="brew-section">
  <h2>The Coffee Stack</h2>

  <p>
    Coffee works in layers.
  </p>

  <p>
    Biology creates potential.  
    Processing shapes chemistry.  
    Roasting unlocks compounds.  
    Grinding controls surface area.  
    Brewing controls extraction.  
    Tasting interprets signals.
  </p>

  <p>
    BrewNotes is built to follow those layers.
  </p>
</section>

  <section class="brew-section">
  <h2>How BrewNotes Works</h2>

  <p>
    BrewNotes is not organized by drinks. It is organized by forces.
  </p>

  <p>
    Methods explain how water meets coffee.  
    Science explains what happens when they touch.  
    Equipment explains how tools shape outcomes.
  </p>

  <p>
    Every page you explore is one layer of the same system.
  </p>

<section class="brew-section">
  <h2>What BrewNotes Is Becoming</h2>

  <p>
    BrewNotes is growing into a living coffee knowledge system.
  </p>

  <p>
    Over time, it will include interactive brew models, extraction visualizations,
    equipment breakdowns, and tasting frameworks.
  </p>

  <p>
    Not to tell you what to brew — but to help you understand why.
  </p>
</section>

  <section class="brew-section">
    <h2>Before Coffee Is Coffee</h2>

    <p>
      Coffee doesn’t begin in cafés. It begins as a fruit.
      What we call a “coffee bean” is actually a seed inside a cherry.
      Every cup you drink is the end of a long biological, chemical,
      and human process.
    </p>

    <p>
      Coffee plants grow in a narrow belt around the Earth called the
      “Coffee Belt” — between the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn.
      Here, altitude, rainfall, soil, and temperature decide how your coffee
      will eventually taste.
    </p>

    <p>
      Two species dominate the world: Arabica and Robusta.
      Arabica is delicate, complex, acidic, and aromatic.
      Robusta is stronger, more bitter, higher in caffeine, and easier to grow.
    </p>

    <p>
      There are others too — Liberica and Excelsa — rarer, stranger,
      and often described as smoky, woody, or wildly fruity.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="brew-section">
    <h2>From Fruit to Flavor</h2>

    <p>
      After harvesting, coffee must be processed. This step alone can
      completely change how coffee tastes.
    </p>

    <p>
      Washed coffees are clean, crisp, and bright.
      Natural coffees are fruity, heavy, and sweet.
      Honey processes sit somewhere in between.
    </p>

    <p>
      Fermentation is not a mistake. It is controlled decay.
      Microorganisms break sugars and proteins into acids, alcohols,
      and aromatic compounds that later become flavor.
    </p>

    <p>
      By the time green coffee is ready to be roasted, it already contains
      hundreds of potential flavor molecules — locked, waiting for heat.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="brew-section">
    <h2>Roasting Is Chemistry</h2>

    <p>
      Roasting is where coffee becomes coffee.
      Heat triggers Maillard reactions, caramelization, and structural collapse.
      The bean expands, cracks, releases steam, and reorganizes internally.
    </p>

    <p>
      Light roasts preserve acidity, florals, and origin character.
      Medium roasts emphasize sweetness and balance.
      Dark roasts highlight bitterness, smoke, and carbonized sugars.
    </p>

    <p>
      Roasting is not about color.
      It is about time, temperature curves, and energy transfer.
      Two beans that look identical can taste nothing alike.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="brew-section">
    <h2>Equipment Is Philosophy</h2>

    <p>
      Espresso machines create pressure.
      Pour-overs create clarity.
      Immersion brewers create depth.
    </p>

    <p>
      Grinders matter more than brewers.
      Burr geometry decides particle distribution.
      Particle distribution decides extraction.
      Extraction decides flavor.
    </p>

    <p>
      The tool you choose is a belief about what coffee should become.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="brew-section">
    <h2>How Tasting Works</h2>

    <p>
      Flavor is not on the tongue alone.
      It is smell, memory, texture, and temperature.
    </p>

    <p>
      Acidity is brightness, not sourness.
      Sweetness is body, not sugar.
      Bitterness is structure, not burning.
    </p>

    <p>
      Most “notes” — chocolate, berries, nuts — are not inside coffee.
      They are associations your brain constructs from aroma compounds.
    </p>

    <p>
      Tasting is pattern recognition.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="brew-section">
    <h2>Brewing Is Extraction</h2>

    <p>
      Brewing coffee is not mixing.
      It is dissolving.
    </p>

    <p>
      Water pulls acids, sugars, lipids, and bitter compounds from ground coffee.
      Too fast and the cup tastes sour.
      Too slow and it becomes hollow or harsh.
    </p>

    <p>
      Grind size, temperature, agitation, ratio, and time are not preferences.
      They are extraction tools.
    </p>

    <p>
      Every brew method is simply a different way of controlling
      contact between water and coffee.
